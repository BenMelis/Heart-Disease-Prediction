## Predicting Heart Disease With Various Machine Learning Models

In this notebook I am trying to predict whether someone has heart disease or not. The dataset used in this project is
the [`Heart Disease dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease).

The different algorithms used in this notebook are:
* Logistic Regression
* K-Nearest Neighbor
* Decision Tree / Classification Tree
* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machine

### Tips & Suggestions

I am very much just starting out with my machine learning journey, and I've only really been into programming for about 
6 months. Any tips, suggestions and feedback is very welcome and greatly appreciated. You can absolutely be critical and
detailed if you want!!

### NOTE:

Nowhere in this project did I use `random_state`. So if you want reproducible results, keep in mind to set the 
random_state!
